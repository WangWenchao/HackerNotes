  As a one of hackers, Vim  is very popular used editor , Where do  what We can  and could. So make Vim as a 'IDE'  as possible

## How  to setup

  first ,you should know about Vim plugins managed by [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim) (Like Bundler , a Ruby gem manager)

  then reference link [square/maximum-awesome](https://github.com/square/maximum-awesome)

  next, you like to use the [tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net) 

  And If are a Mac user , I recommand the iTerm 2  and Macvim
  
  vim config file orgnazition:
```
